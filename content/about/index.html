    <h2>Bio:</h2>
    <p>I was "kicked in the ass" by a seven-year old kid when she asked me : if you cut up a pizza seven times, how many piece would you get.” 
            She sneered at my silence and uttered the words: “ aren’t you a math guy?”</p>
    <p>I later saw this problem in my third year math class. Just then I realized that knowledge is everywhere and that all it takes is a humble mind to attain. 
        This is the lesson I carry with me through my academic, career and personal life. Whether it is competing in competitions or diving into a small cave; 
        finishing my undergrad at University of Toronto or being a <a href="https://www.mmf.utoronto.ca/">MMF</a> Candidate. 

            

    <p>I open my mind towards knowledge and am especially interested in machine learning and finance.
         Here are my <a href="https://shin2suka.github.io/projects/">projects</a>  and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tianyu-shin-ren/">professional experience</a>. 
         I am very enjoyed in <a href="https://utorontodatafest.wordpress.com/2019-asa-datafest-uoft-winning-teams/">2019 ASA DataFest Competition,</a> where I saw the charming of data science and machine learning in a practical way.</p>
